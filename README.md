Employee API

This program gathers random user information from randomuser.me API and uses that information to create an employee directory. The program prints all the gathered employee data to the DOM in the form of info cards containing a employee photo and general personal information. These cards can be clicked be clicked to print a modal that has more detailed information about the employee to the DOM. This modal is interactive as well and allows for cycling through the displayed employees. A search bar exists on the page that allows the user to filter the displayed employees by name. Only employees whose name matches the query will be displayed. The search is case insensitive.

Styling
The neutral background color was slightly changed to a pink hue. Shadows were added to the card, card text, and employee photos to add depth.
